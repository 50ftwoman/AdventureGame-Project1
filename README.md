# Project One: Choose Your Own Story Game


## Introduction
In this project I will design and create an interactive "choose your own" advenute story using CSS, HTML, Javascript, and JQUERY. With an initial choice between two characters, the player will navigate through a storybook to reach their final outcome. 



## Approach
The player will be able to choose a character and continue through five different prompts, navigating down either a "dangerous" path with multiple options for failure, or a "safe" path that will be playable no matter which option until the final card when a player must make a game winning decision. For each slide choice, a character animation will slide from the side of the screen giving a visual representation of the story being told.

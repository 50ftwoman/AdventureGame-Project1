# Project One: Mr. Raccoons Quest for Sunset

![lofi_wireframe] (./Assets/startcard.jpg)


## Introduction
In this project I will design and create an interactive "choose your own" advenute story using CSS, HTML, Javascript, and JQUERY. With an initial choice between two characters, the player will navigate through a storybook to reach their final outcome. 



## Approach
Logic consists of redirecting appropriate answer to corresponding card. 

The player will be able to choose a character and continue through five different prompts, navigating down either a "dangerous" path with multiple options for failure, or a "safe" path that will be playable no matter which option until the final card when a player must make a game winning decision. Each slide will be represented by a visual aide corresponding to the situation or character.
